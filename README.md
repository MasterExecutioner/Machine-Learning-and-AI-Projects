# Machine-Learning-and-AI-Projects
A collection of projects implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms:
1) Traffic Sign classification- A prerequisite for self-driving cars. The project builds and uses a deep neural network model to classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. 
With this model, users are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
