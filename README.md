# Machine-Learning-and-AI-Projects
A collection of projects implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms:
1) Traffic Sign classification- A prerequisite for self-driving cars. The project builds and uses a deep neural network model to classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. 
With this model, users are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

2) Chatbot project- Important for AI, the project will build a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. Special recurrent neural network (LSTM) is used to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then give a random response from the list of responses.

3) Emoji creator- The project will build a deep learning model to classify facial expressions from the images provided by user. This will map the classified emotion to an emoji or an avatar.
